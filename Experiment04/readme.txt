Two Questions

1. Implement the ALEXNET model using transfer learning concepts such as ConvNet as fixed feature extractor, Fine-tuning the ConvNet., Fine-tuning the ConvNet. Select one model from above 3 using following conditions :
  	New dataset is small and similar to original dataset
    New dataset is Large and similar to original dataset

2. Write a python code to implement the VGG 16 .  
  	  Dataset as any image dataset but here you have to add the data augmentation (Eg: 10000images then make as 15000images using data augmentation scheme).
      Include batch normalization at the anyplace followed by first convolution 
      Optimization sgd
